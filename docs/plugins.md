# GoBlog Plugins

GoBlog has a (still experimental) plugin system, that allows adding new functionality to GoBlog without adding anything to the GoBlog source and recompiling GoBlog. Plugins work using the [Yaegi](https://github.com/traefik/yaegi) package by Traefik, are written in Go and are interpreted at run time.

## Configuration

Plugins can be added to GoBlog by adding a "plugins" section to the configuration.

```yaml
plugins:
  - path: embedded:syndication # Use a Plugin provided by GoBlog using the "embedded:" prefix
    import: syndication
    config: # Provide configuration for the plugin
      parameter: syndication
  - path: embedded:demo
    import: demo
  - path: ./plugins/mycustomplugin
    import: mycustompluginpackage
    config:
      abc:
        def:
          one: 1
          two: 2
```

You need to specify the path to the plugin (remember to mount the path to your GoBlog container when using Docker) and the Go packakge and you can additionally provide configuration for the plugin.

## Types of plugins

There are different plugin types for different functionalities a plugin wants to support. A plugin can implement multiple plugin types. You can find more information about the plugin types [in the Go documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/go.goblog.app/app/pkgs/plugintypes).

You can take a look at the demo plugin, which implements many of the plugin types.

## Plugin implementation

All you need to do is creating a Go-file that has a `GetPlugin` function that returns the interface implementation of the desired GoBlog plugin types.

So if you want to create a plugin that implements the `Exec` and `UI` plugin types, you need this:

```go
package yourpluginpackage

import "go.goblog.app/app/pkgs/plugintypes"

type plugin struct {}

func GetPlugin() (plugintypes.Exec,	plugintypes.UI) {
	p := &plugin{}
	return p, p
}
```

Of course, the plugin Go type also needs to have the required functions and methods:

```go
// Exec
func (p *plugin) Exec() {
  // Do something
}

// UI
func (p *plugin) Render(rc plugintypes.RenderContext, rendered io.Reader, modified io.Writer) {
  // Do something, but at least write something to modified, otherwise, the page will stay blank
}
```

If you want to access the configuration that is provided for your plugin, you need to implement the `SetConfig` plugin type. To access some more functions of GoBlog, implement the `SetApp` plugin type that allows you, for example, to access the database or get posts and their parameters.


### Packages provided

Several go modules are already provided by GoBlog, so you don't have to vendor them.

GoBlog modules:

- `go.goblog.app/app/pkgs/plugintypes` (Needed for every plugin)
- `go.goblog.app/app/pkgs/htmlbuilder` (Can be used to generate HTML)
- `go.goblog.app/app/pkgs/bufferpool` (Can be used to manage `bytes.Buffer`s more efficiently)
- `go.goblog.app/app/pkgs/builderpool` (Can be used to manage `strings.Builder`s more efficiently)

Third-party modules

- `github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery` (Can be used to *manipulate* HTML in a jquery-like way)
- `github.com/carlmjohnson/requests` (Can be used to do HTTP requests more easily)
- `github.com/araddon/dateparse` (Can be used to parse dates more easily)

## Plugins

Some simple plugins are included in the main GoBlog repository. Some can be found elsewhere.

### Custom CSS (Path `embedded:customcss`, Import `customcss`)

A plugin that can add custom CSS to every HTML page. Just specify a CSS file and it will minify the file and append it to the rendered HTML head.

#### Config

`file` (string): Path to the custom CSS file.

### Demo (Path `embedded:demo`, Import `demo`)

A simple demo plugin showcasing some of the features plugins can implement. Take a look at the source code, if you want to implement your own plugin.

### Syndication links (Path `embedded:syndication`, Import `syndication`)

Adds hidden `u-syndication` `data` elements to post page when the configured post parameter (default: "syndication") is available.

#### Config

`parameter` (string): Name for the post parameter containing the syndication links.

### Webrings (Path `embedded:webrings`, Import `webrings`)

Adds webring links to the bottom of the blog footer to easily participate in webrings.

#### Config

You can add webring links like this:

```yaml

  default: # Name of the blog
    - title: Webring # Title to show for the webring (required)
      # At least one of link, prev or next is required
      link: https://example.org/ # Link to the webring
      prev: https://example.com/ # Link to previous webring site
      next: https://example.net/ # Link to next webring site
```

### AI generated summary (Path `embedded:aitldr`, Import `aitldr`)

A plugin that uses the ChatGPT API to generated a short one-sentence summary for the blog post (after creating or updating it). To prevent it from generating a summary for a post, add the following post parameter:

```yaml
noaitldr: "true"
```

#### Config

```yaml
config:
  # Required
  apikey: YOUR_OPEN_AI_API_KEY
  # Optional:
  model: gpt-4o # Choose a specific model, default is gpt-4o
  default: # Name of the blog
    title: "Custom title for the summary box:"
```

### AI generated image captions (Path `embedded:aiimage`, Import `aiimage`)

A plugin that uses the ChatGPT API to generated short image captions for images in the blog post (saved in the `images` parameter). It can be triggered by a press on a button on the post. To prevent it from generating captions for a post, add the following post parameter:

```yaml
noaiimage: "true"
```

#### Config

```yaml
config:
  # Required
  apikey: YOUR_OPEN_AI_API_KEY
  # Optional:
  model: gpt-4o # Choose a specific model, default is gpt-4o
  default: # Name of the blog
    title: "Custom prefix for the caption:"
```

### Snow (Path `embedded:snow`, Import `snow`)

A simple plugin that adds a snow animation to the page using some simple CSS and JavaScript.

#### Config

This plugin has no config options.

### AI Bot Block (Path `embedded:aibotblock`, Import `aibotblock`)

A simple plugin that enhances the `/robots.txt` with AI bot user-agents and also blocks requests made by them. Source for the user-agents is [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/ai-robots-txt/ai.robots.txt).
